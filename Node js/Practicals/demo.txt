- Make sure you have a try-catch block in your code.
- Create a new file for each task in one folder.
- variable name must be meaningful.
- Play with each method, put a console log in, check each parameter we can pass to the method, and observe how it is behaving.
- explore fs methods,read articles, perform both methods sychronus as well as asychronus
- send a github link of your task once you complete it.

Task to do

1. list down all the files in a particular folder. (EXTRA: Here,folder name must be dynamic.)

10. using ReadStream to read the file content
11. using the write steam to write the content into the file
12. perform various types of operations using chmode method.

13. perform example which includes all the above functionality in one.
- log should be like this.
- reading file <file name> 1
- file content is this 2
- <print file content here> 3
- write to file <file name> 4
